   abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the spatial variability of stream thermal regimes in British Columbia, Canada, with the specific goal of developing a predictive model to assist in provincial-scale assessment offish habitat. It is part of a broader study to develop an approach to support the designation of "Temperature Sensitive Streams", particularly in relation to the potential effects of forest harvesting and climate change. Stream temperature data were collected from researchers, consultants and government agencies. After checking for data quality, the annual maximum of a seven-day running average of mean daily water temperature (MWAT) was extracted for each station-year. A multiple regression model for the mean MWAT for each station was fitted for stations having basin areas between 1 and 104 km. Predictor variables included the logarithm of catchment area, normal July-August air temperature for the location, the square root of the percentage of glacier cover in the catchment, the square root of the percentage of lake cover in the catchment, the mean catchment elevation, channel slope, a coefficient related to intensity of the mean annual flood, and the deviation of July-August air temperature during the monitoring year(s) from the average during a reference period. Model coefficients were consistent with the physical processes known to govern stream temperature. The standard deviation of prediction errors from a 10-fold cross-validation was 2.1°C. Lack of information on riparian shading is a likely source of a significant portion of the prediction error. The model can be used to provide an initial prediction of stream temperature regime for fish habitat assessment, as well as to provide first-order estimates of the sensitivity of MWAT to climatic warming and glacier retreat. © 2013 Canadian Water Resources Association.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Carnation Creek project is a long-term study of the effects of forestry practices on a small coastal watershed (11 km2) located in southwestern Vancouver Island. Initiated in 1970, this pretreatment versus post-treatment case study consists of 5 years of preharvest, 6 years of during-harvest, and now, 34 years of postharvest research. Forty-one percent of the watershed was clearcut from 1976 to 1981. One tributary sub-basin (1.1 km2) was left as an unharvested reference drainage. Riparian treatments varied from clearcuts to a variable-width buffer. Fish population responses to logging have been complex, and specific to species and life stages. Stream warming due partly to riparian harvest increased the growth and survival of juvenile coho salmon and elevated smolt production by 65\% for nearly three decades. These relatively short-term thermal benefits offset the effects of riparian clearcutting which included accelerated bank erosion, streambed scour, loss of stable in-stream wood, and sediment movement downstream. Landslides in 1984 greatly amplified these effects but took more than 20 years to propagate downstream to reduce fish habitat complexity and increase streambed instability and sediment transport over the entire portion inhabited by anadromous salmon. These delayed impacts have surpassed the thermal-related benefits for coho salmon. Fry-to-smolt overwinter survival has declined from a mean of 50\% between 1982 and 2004 to 15\% since 2005. Coho salmon smolt production has consequently been reduced to below prelogging levels. Results show that forestry-related alterations may take decades to fully develop and persist for decades longer without watershed and stream channel restoration.},

	abstract = {A regionalization of ﬂood data in British Columbia reveals a common scaling with drainage area over the range 0Ð5 ð 102 {\textless} Ad {\textless} 104 km2. This scaling is not a function of ﬂood return period, which implies that simple scaling—consistent with a snowmelt-dominated ﬂow regime—applies to the province. The observed scale relation takes the form Q / A0dÐ75, similar to values reported in previous studies. The scaling relation identiﬁed was used to deﬁne the regional pattern of hydroclimatic variability for ﬂood ﬂows in British Columbia after discounting the effect of drainage area. The pattern was determined by kriging a scale-independent runoff factor k for the mean annual ﬂood, 5 year ﬂood and 20 year ﬂood. The analysis permits quantiﬁcation of uncertainty of the estimates, which can be used in conjunction with the mapped k-ﬁelds to calculate a mean and range for ﬂoods with the identiﬁed return period for ungauged basins. Owing to the sparsity of data, the precision is relatively poor. The standard error is generally less than 75\% of the estimate in the southern half of the province, whereas in the northern half it is often between 75 and 100\%. Examination of the relative increase in ﬂood magnitude with increasing return period reveals spatially consistent but statistically insigniﬁcant differences. Flood magnitude tends to increase more rapidly in the western regions, where rain events may contribute to ﬂood generation. The relative increase in ﬂood magnitude with return period is consistently lower in the eastern mountain ranges, where snowmelt dominates the ﬂood ﬂow regime.

This report aims to integrate the results of coastal hydrologic recovery research into a unified method of determining hydrologic recovery of coastal forest stands. It describes an empirical model of stand level hydrologic recovery that is based on a standard set of recovery curves, and is capable of being applied in a distributed framework. The authors recognize that our understanding of this complex subject is incomplete, and the model has certain limitations. Nevertheless, the model framework represents the state of knowledge of post-disturbance coastal hydrologic recovery processes, it is simple to apply and amenable to integrate with a numerical hydrology simulator, and it is flexible enough to be easily updated as new information becomes available through ongoing research.},

	abstract = {In most interior British Columbia watersheds, the single largest annual hydrologic event is the spring streamflow peak, generated primarily by snowmelt. Consequently, changes in snow regime, as influenced by forest cover, can significantly affect spring peak flows.Loss of forest cover typical of interior British Columbia forests results in 5-70\% and 30-100\% increases in snow accumulation and ablation rates, respectively. However, these changes are not indeterminate, and diminish as forests regrow. The restoration of stand-scale snow processes to pre-harvest conditions is commonly referred to as snow recovery. Data collected in pine-dominated forests in Interior British Columbia suggest that snow recovery increases from approximately 10\% to 80\% as young pine forests grow from 5 to 15 m tall where mature trees are 25 m tall.},
